// # TODO LIST

/*

BUG:
1. Make sure that if we delete the falling object, a new object starts falling

Points so far:
1 - Selection
2 - Manipulation
3 - Travel
4 - System Control (Reset Button)
      - Clicking the reset button with the laser calls ResetGame() function in shot.cs
      - This function needs to be complete - Not sure how to restart the game?

TODO:
5 - Audio
6 - Another System Control (maybe a slider for difficulty -> changes speed)
7 - Custom Gesture - Drop by dropping both hands
Video - Make a video of the game
Blog Post - Make a second blog post by Sunday
